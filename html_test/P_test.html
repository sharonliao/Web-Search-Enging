<p>The MEng in Environmental Engineering focuses on the design and implementation of waste management technologies, including water, wastewater and air treatment processes. Many communities now recognize the importance of sustainable engineering and are seeking to upgrade treatment facilities, capture greenhouse gases and improve environmental impact assessment tools. Students will gain a deeper understanding of environmental problems and regulations from both a national and global perspective. As Concordia houses the local secretariat of the United Nationâ€™s program for global sustainability, students are trained to be at the forefront of sustainable development practices. Beyond the classroom, MEng students have the opportunity to conduct research in various domains of Environmental Engineering. They can also benefit from the <a href="/research/water-energy.html" adhocenable="false">Concordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems (CIWESS)</a>, which promotes research on new systems, technologies and solutions for water, energy and resource conservation.</p>
